It supports the latin pro character set.

CONSIDER: Some special characters are not working with slant on dead weight. (Thank to a bug), this will be fixed later on. English, numbers, math, every this and that works like a charm, only diacritics are troubled:(

It's yours. Feel free to use on anything.

Keep in mind, this is my first variable font ever. Some problems may occur, help me make it better.

Can't wait to see what you make of it.
Love. Love. Love. â™¥
